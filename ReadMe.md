# A Real-Space Implementation of the Bethe-Salpeter formalism for the calculation of optical spectra of large, molecular systems

## A F2003 library 

Key features: 

* Real-space, minimal tight-binding basis
* Two-centre approximation
* Molecular systems only
* Full BSE (not restricted to Tamm-Dancoff approximation)
* Monopole approximation for terms beyond nearest neighbours 
* Tested up to 6000 atoms (as of 2017)
